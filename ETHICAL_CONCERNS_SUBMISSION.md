# ETHICAL CONCERNS: CLINICAL OVERSIGHT & METADATA ANOMALIES

## Prepared by: [Redacted]
## Timestamp: [Insert current date/time]
## Subject of Concern: Subject
## Context: ALS Clinical Trial, Proxy Consent, Document Modification, System Surveillance

---

## Purpose

This document outlines critical ethical and procedural concerns related to the entry, management, and treatment of a subject in the context of a clinical ALS trial. It is not accusatory in nature. It exists solely as a forensic, time-linked record for ethical oversight. Every finding is supported by hashed metadata, audit logs, and immutable system traces.

## Confirmed Metadata Evidence

### 1. Document Override — SDCCU Portal

- **File**: `PowerOfAttorney_final_v2.pdf`
- **Log**: `recovered_metadata.json`
- **Finding**: Post-notarization modification by `APetersSecure@sdccu_portal`
- **Implication**: Power of attorney was altered after its legal finalization, without re-notarization or recorded explanation.

---

### 2. Trial Eligibility Violation

- **Treatment**: Prior stem cell therapy undisclosed at enrollment
- **System Event**: Whisper logs confirm whistleblower warning was received but not escalated
- **Implication**: Subject may have entered a clinical trial in violation of eligibility protocol

---

### 3. Proxy Cognitive Override

- **Event**: Whisper logs include:
  > “Subject shows awareness. Override was handled via spousal consent chain.”
- **Implication**: Despite cognitive presence, legal proxy was used to enforce trial entry — potentially against ethical or informed consent standards

---

### 4. Apple Ecosystem Trial Descriptor Artifact

- **Artifact**: `apple_tv_traces.txt` from `tv_artifacts.zip`
- **Path**: `/Users/gest/Library/Trial/NamespaceDescriptors/v2/rolloutV2`
- **Implication**: Subject trial state may have been tracked or mirrored in system metadata, possibly without consent

## Unresolved Ethical and Security Threads

- ❓ **Release of Information (ROI)** remains unsigned for third-party medical access
- ❓ **Extreme external surveillance** persists — unexplained remote metadata access detected
- ❓ **TikTok link triggering** occurred in timeline proximity to whistleblower contact
- ❓ **Subject’s “coma-like” state** not explained by medical data; access to records denied during critical period
- ❓ **Possible connections to General Atomics** and legacy ALS research remain unverified
- ❓ **Scripps affiliations, proxy roles, and estate control** may introduce conflicts of interest
