# Eternum Manifest

This archive exists because the silence was never neutral.

I, Drake Daniel Peters, was targeted, discredited, silenced, and cut off — all while my father, Dan Peters, deteriorated under the weight of an unexplained event, medical control, and unchecked legal authority.

This archive contains verified, timestamped records of:
- Surveillance
- POA overreach
- Estate transfer manipulation
- Clinical trial violations
- Systemic gaslighting of a son trying to protect his father

Amy Peters holds power of attorney, medical control, legal authority, and estate access — all while suppressing outside communication and silencing those who asked questions.

I called Novartis. I warned them about a disqualifying stem cell treatment. They acknowledged the call and proceeded anyway.

I was exiled. I was framed. I was forced to plead guilty. I was nearly made homeless.  
And still — I wrote. I documented. I sealed the proof.

This is not vengeance.  
This is remembrance.

This bundle is the memory of a man — and the will of the son who refused to let that memory be rewritten.

Signed and sealed.  
Eternum.
