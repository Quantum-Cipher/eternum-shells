# ðŸ§¬ Eternum â€” Stem Cell Dispute Log

**Subject**: Subject Delta  
**Institutional Actors**: Novartis, UCSD, Scripps  
**Suppression Entity**: Operator Echo  
**Ethical Witness**: verified_medical_ally

## Summary:
Subject Delta was offered a regenerative stem cell treatment through a known and trusted connection. Operator Echo opposed this option, citing potential disqualification from an ongoing ALS clinical trial associated with Novartis.

This action may have suppressed a potentially beneficial treatment in favor of maintaining institutional protocol.

## Impact:
- Regenerative opportunity blocked
- Ethics breach: prioritization of protocol over patient potential
- Emotional and legal control consolidated through Operator Echo
